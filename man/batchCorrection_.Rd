\usage{
batchCorrection_(mergedset, batch, design, idtype)
}
\arguments{
\item{mergedset}{An ExpressionSet. The output of the function `merge_()`.}

\item{batch}{Takes the results from \code{createBatch_()} as input.}

\item{design}{A object. The output of the function `createDiagnosisDesignBatch_()`.}

\description{
Helper function correcting for batch effects and mapping affy probes to Entrez IDs
}
\details{
This function takes a Bioconductor's ExpressionSet class (the output of the function `merge()`) and outputs a batch corrected
  matrix containing expression data. In order to correct for occurring batch effects and other unwanted variation in high-throughput
  experiments the `ComBat` function from the sva package is conducted.
  The affy probes are mapped to their Entrez IDs. Thereby, empty and replicated character strings are
  removed.
